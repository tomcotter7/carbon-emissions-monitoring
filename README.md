# Identification and Monitoring of Monitoring Carbon Producing Processes

This project was to design an application which can monitor carbon emissions within a power plant. Through using the application, the user could gain insight to any issues as to why there are high carbon emissions, and hence can begin to resolve the issue. The application will focus on presenting this information in a concise format, so the responsiveness of analysing the data presented and knowing where issues are occurring is fast.

## Getting Started

In order to correctly get a copy of this project initialised, we will outline steps to get this up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes, as well as running the application live on a system.

### Prerequisites

Here we will address what software is needed in order to continue development, as well as running this application on your local machine.

| Program                               | Why it is Needed                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Intelligent Plant Industrial AppStore | This is for the users who primarily just want to run this application to analyse carbon emissions. This will be used to access the application. Account setup will need to happen to gain access to the AppStore, accounts such as Microsoft or LinkedIn can be used to authorise yourself as an IntelligentPlant user. |
| Visual Studio (Developers)            | This program will allow you to edit the source code, for C#, HTML, and JS used within this application. This will be useful for developers wanting to extend this project to add more features and testing. Note: you will need to install ISS Express toolbar when installing Visual Studio to run this application on Windows, for Mac, you can ignore this step. |
| Node.js (Developers)                  | If you are interested in GUI development with this application, on your local machine, you will need to install Node.js, to translate JSX into JS. What this enables is in the /src folder, as you type your React JS code, it will translate the JSX declarations into JS so it can interpret and compile the data. |
| Python Anywhere (Developers)          | This is a web host which stores our machine learning files, coded in Python. If you wish to develop more algorithms, this platform will be needed to get machine learning running within the application. |

### Installing

To install this application to analyse carbon emissions within the plant, go onto the Intelligent Plant Industrial AppStore. From there, register an account using account information which is valid for their authentication. After that, you will be able to access the application and be able to run it on your web browser, preferably Google Chrome.

------

### Testing

This section here will describe how to run the tests within the application to check for validity with data outputs.

  ### Acknowledgements

  We, Team 35 of University of Nottingham, would like to thank the University itself, and Intelligent Plant for allowing us to experience how a project would be handled in industry. Throughout our development of this project, great research was needed since this was very unfamiliar territory of software engineering for some, and we are glad for this experience because it really helped with excelling in project management and maintaining our progress.

  Special mention to Josh Plumbly, Bruce Nicolson (Intelligent Plant) and Alex Johnstone (Ithica Energy) for helping throughout our project development. Without your support, we would have struggled a lot, so we all as a team appreciate the effort you have shown us throughout our time developing this application.

  Another final mention will be our supervisor, Isaac Triguero Velazquez, for giving us constant feedback and helping us maintain the correct focal point for this project. We appreciate your help throughout and will always be grateful for the help you have given.
